<p class="caption2">WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM</p>


<p>Powder-post beetles cause extensive
damage to wood in the structure of
buildings and to wood products used in
homes.</p>

<p>The larvae, or grubs, feed on the
starch or the cellulose in wood. As
they feed, they bore irregular tunnels
through the wood. Borings left in the
tunnels have the consistency of powder.</p>

<p>Powder-post beetles can be controlled
by applying an insecticide to the infested
wood. How it is applied depends
on the kind of beetle to be controlled
and on the extent and location
of the infestation. In some circumstances
a spray will suffice; in others,
fumigation is necessary.</p>

<p class="caption2">KINDS</p>

<p>Powder-post beetles are divided into
five groups&mdash;lyctus beetles, anobiid
beetles, bostrichid beetles, cerambycid
beetles, and cossonid weevils.</p>

<p>Lyctus beetles are reddish to blackish,
about &frac14; inch long, and slightly
flattened. One common species is
known as the southern lyctus beetle.</p>

<p>Anobiid beetles are similar to lyctus
beetles in color and size, but are
cylindrical. The common furniture
beetle and the death-watch beetle belong
in this group.</p>

<p>Bostrichid beetles are reddish,
brown, or black; they are &#8539; to &frac34;
inch long, and cylindrical.</p>

<p>The heads of anobiids and bostrichids
are directed downward and are
covered by a "hood."</p>

<p>The cerambycids, also known as
roundheaded or long-horned beetles,
are blue, black, or pale yellow to reddish
brown, and often bear distinctive
markings on the head or the wing covers.
They are &frac12; to 1 inch long,
and vary in shape. The old house
borer belongs in this group. It is
black, and has grayish markings on
the wing covers. It is about &frac34; inch
long.</p>

<p>Cossonid weevils are reddish brown
or black, &#8539; to &#8533; inch long, and
oval to cylindrical. Their heads are
drawn out to form a short, broad beak.
Cossonids are the only weevils that infest
wood; other weevils infest grain
or growing crops.</p>


<p class="caption2">LIFE CYCLE</p>

<p>The adult females lay eggs on or in
wood. The eggs hatch into larvae,
which develop as they tunnel the wood.
The tunneling continues throughout the
larval stage, which lasts for months or
years, depending on the kind of beetle.</p>

<p>The full-grown larvae transform to
pupae, which become adult beetles.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_1"><i>Cover:</i></a> Adult of an anobiid beetle, <i>Xyletinus
peltatus</i>, and pine sill damaged by larvae of
this beetle.</p>

<p>The adults of many kinds of powder-post
beetles bore circular holes to the
surface of the wood and emerge; others
make oval holes. Some emerge in
early spring; others, including the old
house borer, emerge in early summer.
Mating and egg laying follow.</p>

<p>The life cycle of lyctus beetles varies
from 3 months to 1 year, depending on
the species and on regional differences
in temperature, moisture, and availability
of wood of high food value.</p>

<p>The life cycle of anobiid beetles is
sometimes completed in about 1 year
and sometimes in 2 years.</p>

<p>Most of the bostrichids and cerambycids
complete the cycle in about 1 year,
but a few of the latter require several
years. The old house borer, a cerambycid,
requires 5 to 7 years in the North,
and less time in the South. In all but
a few months of its life cycle, it is in the
larval stage. Larvae 3 or 4 years old
are often found in the woodwork of
buildings only 1 or 2 years old&mdash;evidence
that stored lumber is a source of
infestation.</p>

<p>Cossonid weevils complete the cycle
in about 1 year.</p>


<p class="caption2">EGG LAYING</p>

<p>The females lay eggs on or in wood
that satisfies their egg-laying requirements
and the food requirements of the
larvae. These requirements differ
among the species. Hence different
kinds of wood are infested by different
species of beetles.</p>

<p>Lyctus beetles infest hardwoods.
Cossonid weevils infest softwoods.
Some anobiids, bostrichids, and cerambycids
infest hardwoods, and some infest
softwoods.</p>

<p>For some species bark is an egg-laying
requirement; for others it is not.</p>

<p>Some anobiids infest moist wood containing
decay organisms, which appear
to aid development of the larvae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span></p>

<p>The porosity of the wood, the moisture
content, the starch or cellulose
content&mdash;these also relate to egg laying.</p>

<p>The adults of some species remain
on the wood from which they emerge,
and reinfest it. Others crawl or fly to
similar wood and attack it.</p>

<p>A beetle may lay only a few eggs
or as many as 60 or 70; the number
depends on the species of beetle and
on the condition of the wood.</p>

<p class="caption3">Infestations in Hardwoods</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seasoned hardwoods.</span>&mdash;Beetles that
infest seasoned hardwoods lay eggs on
or in the wood from which they emerge.
Hence the same wood may be infested
repeatedly. These beetles do not require
bark for egg laying.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/page4.png" width="215" height="259" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Oak board damaged by larvae of the southern
lyctus beetle.</div>
</div>

<p>Lyctus beetles lay eggs in exposed
pores in the sapwood of oak, ash,
hickory, walnut, pecan, gum, persimmon,
maple, cherry, and a few other
hardwood species. The larvae are
found in hardwood flooring, furniture,
picture frames, and trim.</p>

<p>Anobiid and cerambycid beetles lay
eggs in crevices on the surface of the
wood; cerambycids also lay eggs in
emergence holes.</p>

<p>Bostrichid beetles that bore into seasoned
hardwoods often bore chambers
at the sides of their tunnels and lay eggs
in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unseasoned hardwoods.</span>&mdash;Bostrichids
that infest green and seasoning
hardwoods lay eggs in pores leading
from the entrance tunnels. The red-shouldered
shothole borer is one of
these. Bostrichids frequently attack
bark-covered wood. They usually do
not reinfest the wood from which they
emerge.</p>

<p class="caption3">Infestations in Softwoods</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seasoned softwoods.</span>&mdash;Some kinds
of beetles infest seasoned softwood
lumber used in the structure of buildings.</p>

<p>Certain of the bostrichids require
bark for egg laying. They infest lumber
that has bark on the edges. Such
lumber is often used in framing, subflooring,
and roofing. The females lay
eggs in the bark. The larvae of some
species complete their development in
it; others go to the adjacent wood to
do so. The adult females may reinfest
the wood from which they emerge.</p>

<p>Other beetles that infest seasoned
softwoods do not require bark for egg
laying. Among them are the old house
borer and the cossonid weevils. The
females lay eggs in crevices in the wood.
They may infest the same wood repeatedly.</p>

<p>The old house borer infests framing
and subflooring. It is found in old and
new construction and in stored lumber.
Cossonid weevils are found in pine
flooring, baseboards, wall stops, and
roof trusses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unseasoned softwoods.</span>&mdash;The beetles
that infest green and seasoning
softwoods include several cerambycids&mdash;for
example, the black-horned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
pine borer&mdash;and a few bostrichids.
Most of these beetles require bark for
egg laying. The adult females usually
do not reinfest the wood from which
they emerge; they seek other unseasoned
wood and lay eggs in the bark.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption3">Infestations in Bamboo</p>

<p>Certain species of bostrichid, cerambycid,
and lyctus beetles infest bamboo
products such as furniture. Venetian
blinds, draw drapes, baskets, fans, and
fishing poles.</p>

<p>Plant-quarantine inspectors at United
States ports of entry often intercept the
beetles in bamboo products imported
from the Far East. Among the beetles
intercepted are the bamboo powder-post
beetle, a bostrichid, and the bamboo
borer, a cerambycid. These beetles
and the lyctus beetles may reinfest
the material from which they emerge.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Pine floor joist damaged by larvae of the old house borer</div>

<p class="caption2">DAMAGE</p>

<p>The increase in building activity that
followed World War II brought the destructiveness
of powder-post beetles to
widespread attention. The more buildings,
the more damage.</p>

<p>The old house borer is rapidly
spreading over the eastern half of the
United States, and is found more and
more in lumber used in new construction.
It is becoming one of the most
serious pests of wood in buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span></p>

<p>Powder-post beetles damage wood
by tunneling and by cutting surface
holes.</p>

<p>Tunneling is done by the larvae of
all kinds of powder-post beetles, and
by adult bostrichids and cossonid
weevils. The larvae of anobiid beetles
leave elongate pellets of excreted wood
in their tunnels. Other larvae leave
powderlike borings. Severely damaged
wood becomes a crumbly mass of
pellets or of borings, and sometimes
has a honeycombed appearance.</p>

<p>Since the insects do most of their
tunneling in sapwood, structural damage
is rare in large timbers.</p>

<p>Surface holes mar the appearance of
wood. Those most commonly seen
are made by adult beetles when they
emerge from the wood. Those made
by many of the smaller beetles are
about &#8539; inch in diameter. They give
wood the appearance of having been
hit by buckshot, and are called shotholes.
Larger beetles make holes &frac14; to
&#8540; inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Emergence holes made by the old
house borer are oval. The lengthwise
measurement is about &frac14; inch.</p>

<p>The larvae of some species, including
the lyctus beetles, make holes to
the surface of the wood and expel borings
through them. The larvae of the
old house borer seldom pierce the surface;
they pack their borings behind
them.</p>


<p class="caption2">DETECTION</p>

<p>Aside from observing tunneled
wood, there are several ways of detecting
powder-post beetle damage.</p>

<p>You may see surface holes, or borings
that have been ejected from them.
The borings may be in piles near the
holes or, where timbers overhead are
attacked, they may be on the floor
below.</p>

<p>You may see adult beetles crawling
on the wood.</p>

<p>In quiet surroundings you may hear
a rasping or ticking sound that is made
by tunneling larvae. This is the best
way to detect larvae of the old house
borer. Their ticking is sometimes
audible several feet from where they
are working. By determining the
source of the sound and by probing
the wood with a sharp tool, you can
locate the tunnels. A further aid is to
look for blistered wood.</p>

<p>Sometimes the larvae of cerambycid
beetles can be heard working beneath
bark on green or partially seasoned
wood. They frequently are found in
firewood. They resemble the old
house borer, but they have different
habits and do not infest seasoned
wood. When the adults emerge, they
seek more green wood to attack. If
they cannot escape from the building,
they die in a few days.</p>


<p class="caption2">WHAT TO DO</p>

<p>Consider whether the control problem
is one that you can handle yourself
or whether it is one that requires
the services of a pest-control operator.</p>

<p>If you have a severe infestation, or
one that is behind paneled or plastered
walls, or in some other hard-to-reach
place, it may be that only an
experienced pest-control operator with
the proper equipment can do a satisfactory
job.</p>

<p>If the infestation is light and easy
to reach, you may be able to handle
the control job yourself. Spraying or
brush-coating the wood with an insecticide
may suffice.</p>

<p>If wood has been so badly damaged
that its structural strength is impaired,
it should be replaced. Coordinate
the repair work with the control
work.</p>

<p class="caption3">Spraying or Brushing</p>

<p>Beetles that make numerous small
holes in the surface of wood are controlled
by saturating the wood with
a deodorized kerosene, such as deobase
or ultrasene, which contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
either 5 percent DDT, 2 percent
chlordane, 0.5 percent dieldrin, or 0.5
percent lindane.</p>

<p>With 1 gallon of any of these materials
you can treat at least 100 square
feet of wood surface. Use no more of
the material in a single application
than is needed to wet the surface. Repeat
the application until the wood is
saturated. Apply with a garden
sprayer or a paintbrush.</p>

<p>The treatment is also effective
against infestations in furniture and
other wood products.</p>

<p>For best results in treating any kind
of material, first remove the finish.
This is especially desirable when you
treat a large area, such as a floor, but
it may not be desirable when you treat
ornamental products. Where an infestation
in a floor is so small that removal
of the finish is undesirable, go
ahead and treat the floor, but do not
walk on it until it has dried. The drying
takes several hours.</p>

<p>The old house borer and other
beetles that do not make entrance holes
in the surface of the wood can also be
controlled by surface applications of
these chemicals. Larger quantities
must be used, however, especially where
thicker wood is concerned, such as floor
joists, studs, and roof rafters. For
such materials, at least 1.5 pints of the
insecticide per cubic foot of wood is
needed to reach the beetle larvae. This
is equivalent to treating the exposed
surfaces of 7 linear feet of a 2- by 10-inch
floor joist, 12 feet of a 2- by 6-inch
roof rafter, 18 feet of 2- by 4-inch
studding, or 12 square feet of subflooring.
Even with this thorough treatment,
it may take from 3 weeks to 3
months before all the larvae are
reached and killed.</p>

<p>The homeowner can best apply such
a quantity of insecticide by using a
sprayer or a pint-size plastic wash
bottle of the squeeze type, equipped
with a tube that will produce a pinpoint
stream. This makes it possible
to apply small enough quantities to
cover the surface without causing the
liquid to run off. Repeated applications
at different times are necessary
for complete absorption by the wood
and effective penetration. A pest-control
operator can obtain results
quickly by injecting the chemical under
pressure through boreholes spaced
at short intervals in the infested wood.</p>

<p class="caption3">Slow-Diffusion Method</p>

<p>Where pressure equipment is not
available and you want to use the bore-hole
or slow-diffusion method on isolated
infestations in wood that is
readily accessible, you can use the following
procedure:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Bore a downslanting hole about &frac12;
inch in diameter and 1 inch deep into the
wood near the place where a larva is working.</p>

<p>2. Insert a tight-fitting metal or glass tube
in the hole. Let about &frac14; inch of the tube
project.</p>

<p>3. Place one end of a rubber tube over
the projecting portion of the metal or glass
tube, and connect the other end with a
funnel. The funnel should be supported so
that it will stay in place until the treatment
has been completed.</p>

<p>4. Pour insecticide into the funnel. Use
any of the preparations mentioned in the
discussion of spraying and brushing. Leave
the equipment in place about 48 hours, or
until the insecticide is taken up. The insecticide
flows into the infested wood, is
absorbed for a distance of several inches
around the hole, and reaches and kills the
larva.</p></div>

<p>If several larvae are working in
places as much as 18 inches apart,
individual treatment is needed.</p>

<p class="caption3">Fumigation</p>

<p>Treatment of a heavy infestation of
powder-post beetles by spraying or
brushing or by the slow-diffusion
method is impractical where the wood
is hard to reach; particularly when it
is located behind plastered walls or
covered by paneling or insulation.</p>

<p><a id="fumigator" name="fumigator"></a>Such an infestation can be controlled
by fumigation&mdash;<i>but this work must be
done by a licensed fumigator</i>.</p>

<p>Hydrocyanic acid gas or methyl
bromide gas is used in fumigating.
Each is very poisonous, and heavy
dosages have to be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span></p>

<p>After fumigation, the building must
be aired to make it safe for reoccupancy.
The fumigating and the airing
require 2 to 4 days.</p>

<p>Fumigation methods of the "home-remedy"
type&mdash;such as burning sulfur
candles&mdash;are ineffective because the
fumigant does not penetrate the infested
wood.</p>


<p class="caption2">PRECAUTIONS</p>

<p>The insecticides mentioned in this
leaflet are poisonous to people and to
animals. Keep them where children
and pets cannot reach them. Do not
let them come in contact with the body.
When applying them, wear rubber
gloves, a cellulose acetate type of face-guard,
and a rubber or leather apron.
When spraying an overhead area, do
not stand directly under it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guarding against explosions.</span>&mdash;Apply
a coarse spray. It is effective and
safe to use. A concentrated fine mist is
ineffective and may explode in the
presence of a spark or flame. Do not
smoke while spraying. Shut off pilot
lights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pressure.</span>&mdash;In spraying, use only
enough pressure to wet the surface of
the wood. Too much pressure may
cause spray to splash onto the body.
If you apply the insecticide in an
enclosed place, make sure that the air
can circulate freely. Keep doors and
windows open; if necessary, use a fan.
The purpose is to prevent odors from
accumulating in the building.</p>

<p>If you treat a floor that has a finished
ceiling under it&mdash;for example,
the floor of a second-story room&mdash;avoid
applying too much material. If
you do, it may run through to the ceiling
and cause a stain. Removal of
the floor finish before applying the insecticide
makes it unnecessary to apply
a large amount; the wood absorbs
most of it.</p>

<p>If you apply the oil solution to parquet
flooring, do it very lightly. If
you apply too much, the oil may dissolve
the asphalt in which the flooring
is set. The dissolved asphalt may
stain the floor. Around the edges of
the floor, it may "creep up" and damage
the walls.</p>

<p>If you have applied insecticide with
a garden sprayer, rinse out the tank
and hose before putting the sprayer
away. This prevents the gaskets from
shriveling and keeps oil from getting
on plants the next time the sprayer is
used in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food cabinets.</span>&mdash;In treating a food
cabinet, do not use an insecticide because
it might contaminate food. Use
deodorized kerosene alone. It has
little odor and evaporates quickly.
Take the cabinet outdoors to treat it,
and leave it there until the kerosene
odor disappears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fumigation.</span>&mdash;The fact that fumigation
work must be done by a licensed
operator is stated on <a href="#fumigator">page 7</a>.</p>

<p>Only isolated buildings can be
safely fumigated. If an apartment, a
row house, or part of a duplex were
fumigated, the gas might penetrate
walls and kill persons in an adjoining
unit.</p>

<p>Methyl bromide gas is odorless, but
in the presence of articles having a
high sulfur content, or containing animal
matter, sponge rubber, or iodized
salt, a chemical change takes place and
a garliclike odor is apt to be given off
later. Before this gas is used, see
whether such articles are in the building;
if they are, remove them. This
need not be done if hydrocyanic acid
gas is used. However, hydrocyanic
acid gas tarnishes silver and spoils unexposed
photographic film; before it
is used, remove silver and film.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
