<p class="caption2">WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM</p>


<p>Powder-post beetles cause extensive
damage to wood in the structure of
buildings and to wood products used in
homes.</p>

<p>The larvae, or grubs, feed on the
starch or the cellulose in wood. As
they feed, they bore irregular tunnels
through the wood. Borings left in the
tunnels have the consistency of powder.</p>

<p>Powder-post beetles can be controlled
by applying an insecticide to the infested
wood. How it is applied depends
on the kind of beetle to be controlled
and on the extent and location
of the infestation. In some circumstances
a spray will suffice; in others,
fumigation is necessary.</p>

<p class="caption2">KINDS</p>

<p>Powder-post beetles are divided into
five groups&mdash;lyctus beetles, anobiid
beetles, bostrichid beetles, cerambycid
beetles, and cossonid weevils.</p>

<p>Lyctus beetles are reddish to blackish,
about &frac14; inch long, and slightly
flattened. One common species is
known as the southern lyctus beetle.</p>

<p>Anobiid beetles are similar to lyctus
beetles in color and size, but are
cylindrical. The common furniture
beetle and the death-watch beetle belong
in this group.</p>

<p>Bostrichid beetles are reddish,
brown, or black; they are &#8539; to &frac34;
inch long, and cylindrical.</p>

<p>The heads of anobiids and bostrichids
are directed downward and are
covered by a "hood."</p>

<p>The cerambycids, also known as
roundheaded or long-horned beetles,
are blue, black, or pale yellow to reddish
brown, and often bear distinctive
markings on the head or the wing covers.
They are &frac12; to 1 inch long,
and vary in shape. The old house
borer belongs in this group. It is
black, and has grayish markings on
the wing covers. It is about &frac34; inch
long.</p>

<p>Cossonid weevils are reddish brown
or black, &#8539; to &#8533; inch long, and
oval to cylindrical. Their heads are
drawn out to form a short, broad beak.
Cossonids are the only weevils that infest
wood; other weevils infest grain
or growing crops.</p>


<p class="caption2">LIFE CYCLE</p>

<p>The adult females lay eggs on or in
wood. The eggs hatch into larvae,
which develop as they tunnel the wood.
The tunneling continues throughout the
larval stage, which lasts for months or
years, depending on the kind of beetle.</p>

<p>The full-grown larvae transform to
pupae, which become adult beetles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span></p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Page_1"><i>Cover:</i></a> Adult of an anobiid beetle, <i>Xyletinus
peltatus</i>, and pine sill damaged by larvae of
this beetle.</p>

<p>The adults of many kinds of powder-post
beetles bore circular holes to the
surface of the wood and emerge; others
make oval holes. Some emerge in
early spring; others, including the old
house borer, emerge in early summer.
Mating and egg laying follow.</p>

<p>The life cycle of lyctus beetles varies
from 3 months to 1 year, depending on
the species and on regional differences
in temperature, moisture, and availability
of wood of high food value.</p>

<p>The life cycle of anobiid beetles is
sometimes completed in about 1 year
and sometimes in 2 years.</p>

<p>Most of the bostrichids and cerambycids
complete the cycle in about 1 year,
but a few of the latter require several
years. The old house borer, a cerambycid,
requires 5 to 7 years in the North,
and less time in the South. In all but
a few months of its life cycle, it is in the
larval stage. Larvae 3 or 4 years old
are often found in the woodwork of
buildings only 1 or 2 years old&mdash;evidence
that stored lumber is a source of
infestation.</p>

<p>Cossonid weevils complete the cycle
in about 1 year.</p>


<p class="caption2">EGG LAYING</p>

<p>The females lay eggs on or in wood
that satisfies their egg-laying requirements
and the food requirements of the
larvae. These requirements differ
among the species. Hence different
kinds of wood are infested by different
species of beetles.</p>

<p>Lyctus beetles infest hardwoods.
Cossonid weevils infest softwoods.
Some anobiids, bostrichids, and cerambycids
infest hardwoods, and some infest
softwoods.</p>

<p>For some species bark is an egg-laying
requirement; for others it is not.</p>

<p>Some anobiids infest moist wood containing
decay organisms, which appear
to aid development of the larvae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span></p>

<p>The porosity of the wood, the moisture
content, the starch or cellulose
content&mdash;these also relate to egg laying.</p>

<p>The adults of some species remain
on the wood from which they emerge,
and reinfest it. Others crawl or fly to
similar wood and attack it.</p>

<p>A beetle may lay only a few eggs
or as many as 60 or 70; the number
depends on the species of beetle and
on the condition of the wood.</p>

<p class="caption3">Infestations in Hardwoods</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seasoned hardwoods.</span>&mdash;Beetles that
infest seasoned hardwoods lay eggs on
or in the wood from which they emerge.
Hence the same wood may be infested
repeatedly. These beetles do not require
bark for egg laying.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/page4.png" width="215" height="259" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Oak board damaged by larvae of the southern
lyctus beetle.</div>
</div>

<p>Lyctus beetles lay eggs in exposed
pores in the sapwood of oak, ash,
hickory, walnut, pecan, gum, persimmon,
maple, cherry, and a few other
hardwood species. The larvae are
found in hardwood flooring, furniture,
picture frames, and trim.</p>

<p>Anobiid and cerambycid beetles lay
eggs in crevices on the surface of the
wood; cerambycids also lay eggs in
emergence holes.</p>

<p>Bostrichid beetles that bore into seasoned
hardwoods often bore chambers
at the sides of their tunnels and lay eggs
in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unseasoned hardwoods.</span>&mdash;Bostrichids
that infest green and seasoning
hardwoods lay eggs in pores leading
from the entrance tunnels. The red-shouldered
shothole borer is one of
these. Bostrichids frequently attack
bark-covered wood. They usually do
not reinfest the wood from which they
emerge.</p>

<p class="caption3">Infestations in Softwoods</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seasoned softwoods.</span>&mdash;Some kinds
of beetles infest seasoned softwood
lumber used in the structure of buildings.</p>

<p>Certain of the bostrichids require
bark for egg laying. They infest lumber
that has bark on the edges. Such
lumber is often used in framing, subflooring,
and roofing. The females lay
eggs in the bark. The larvae of some
species complete their development in
it; others go to the adjacent wood to
do so. The adult females may reinfest
the wood from which they emerge.</p>

<p>Other beetles that infest seasoned
softwoods do not require bark for egg
laying. Among them are the old house
borer and the cossonid weevils. The
females lay eggs in crevices in the wood.
They may infest the same wood repeatedly.</p>

<p>The old house borer infests framing
and subflooring. It is found in old and
new construction and in stored lumber.
Cossonid weevils are found in pine
flooring, baseboards, wall stops, and
roof trusses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unseasoned softwoods.</span>&mdash;The beetles
that infest green and seasoning
softwoods include several cerambycids&mdash;for
example, the black-horned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
pine borer&mdash;and a few bostrichids.
Most of these beetles require bark for
egg laying. The adult females usually
do not reinfest the wood from which
they emerge; they seek other unseasoned
wood and lay eggs in the bark.</p>

<p class="caption3">Infestations in Bamboo</p>

<p>Certain species of bostrichid, cerambycid,
and lyctus beetles infest bamboo
products such as furniture. Venetian
blinds, draw drapes, baskets, fans, and
fishing poles.</p>

<p>Plant-quarantine inspectors at United
States ports of entry often intercept the
beetles in bamboo products imported
from the Far East. Among the beetles
intercepted are the bamboo powder-post
beetle, a bostrichid, and the bamboo
borer, a cerambycid. These beetles
and the lyctus beetles may reinfest
the material from which they emerge.</p>

</div>


<p class="caption2">DAMAGE</p>

<p>The increase in building activity that
followed World War II brought the destructiveness
of powder-post beetles to
widespread attention. The more buildings,
the more damage.</p>

<p>The old house borer is rapidly
spreading over the eastern half of the
United States, and is found more and
more in lumber used in new construction.
It is becoming one of the most
serious pests of wood in buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span></p>

<p>Powder-post beetles damage wood
by tunneling and by cutting surface
holes.</p>

<p>Tunneling is done by the larvae of
all kinds of powder-post beetles, and
by adult bostrichids and cossonid
weevils. The larvae of anobiid beetles
leave elongate pellets of excreted wood
in their tunnels. Other larvae leave
powderlike borings. Severely damaged
wood becomes a crumbly mass of
pellets or of borings, and sometimes
has a honeycombed appearance.</p>

<p>Since the insects do most of their
tunneling in sapwood, structural damage
is rare in large timbers.</p>

<p>Surface holes mar the appearance of
wood. Those most commonly seen
are made by adult beetles when they
emerge from the wood. Those made
by many of the smaller beetles are
about &#8539; inch in diameter. They give
wood the appearance of having been
hit by buckshot, and are called shotholes.
Larger beetles make holes &frac14; to
&#8540; inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Emergence holes made by the old
house borer are oval. The lengthwise
measurement is about &frac14; inch.</p>

<p>The larvae of some species, including
the lyctus beetles, make holes to
the surface of the wood and expel borings
through them. The larvae of the
old house borer seldom pierce the surface;
they pack their borings behind
them.</p>


<p class="caption2">DETECTION</p>

<p>Aside from observing tunneled
wood, there are several ways of detecting
powder-post beetle damage.</p>

<p>You may see surface holes, or borings
that have been ejected from them.
The borings may be in piles near the
holes or, where timbers overhead are
attacked, they may be on the floor
below.</p>

<p>You may see adult beetles crawling
on the wood.</p>

<p>In quiet surroundings you may hear
a rasping or ticking sound that is made
by tunneling larvae. This is the best
way to detect larvae of the old house
borer. Their ticking is sometimes
audible several feet from where they
are working. By determining the
source of the sound and by probing
the wood with a sharp tool, you can
locate the tunnels. A further aid is to
look for blistered wood.</p>

<p>Sometimes the larvae of cerambycid
beetles can be heard working beneath
bark on green or partially seasoned
wood. They frequently are found in
firewood. They resemble the old
house borer, but they have different
habits and do not infest seasoned
wood. When the adults emerge, they
seek more green wood to attack. If
they cannot escape from the building,
they die in a few days.</p>


<p class="caption2">WHAT TO DO</p>

<p>Consider whether the control problem
is one that you can handle yourself
or whether it is one that requires
the services of a pest-control operator.</p>

<p>If you have a severe infestation, or
one that is behind paneled or plastered
walls, or in some other hard-to-reach
place, it may be that only an
experienced pest-control operator with
the proper equipment can do a satisfactory
job.</p>

<p>If the infestation is light and easy
to reach, you may be able to handle
the control job yourself. Spraying or
brush-coating the wood with an insecticide
may suffice.</p>

<p>If wood has been so badly damaged
that its structural strength is impaired,
it should be replaced. Coordinate
the repair work with the control
work.</p>

<p class="caption3">Spraying or Brushing</p>

<p>Beetles that make numerous small
holes in the surface of wood are controlled
by saturating the wood with
a deodorized kerosene, such as deobase
or ultrasene, which contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
either 5 percent DDT, 2 percent
chlordane, 0.5 percent dieldrin, or 0.5
percent lindane.</p>

<p>With 1 gallon of any of these materials
you can treat at least 100 square
feet of wood surface. Use no more of
the material in a single application
than is needed to wet the surface. Repeat
the application until the wood is
saturated. Apply with a garden
sprayer or a paintbrush.</p>

<p>The treatment is also effective
against infestations in furniture and
other wood products.</p>

<p>For best results in treating any kind
of material, first remove the finish.
This is especially desirable when you
treat a large area, such as a floor, but
it may not be desirable when you treat
ornamental products. Where an infestation
in a floor is so small that removal
of the finish is undesirable, go
ahead and treat the floor, but do not
walk on it until it has dried. The drying
takes several hours.</p>

<p>The old house borer and other
beetles that do not make entrance holes
in the surface of the wood can also be
controlled by surface applications of
these chemicals. Larger quantities
must be used, however, especially where
thicker wood is concerned, such as floor
joists, studs, and roof rafters. For
such materials, at least 1.5 pints of the
insecticide per cubic foot of wood is
needed to reach the beetle larvae. This
is equivalent to treating the exposed
surfaces of 7 linear feet of a 2- by 10-inch
floor joist, 12 feet of a 2- by 6-inch
roof rafter, 18 feet of 2- by 4-inch
studding, or 12 square feet of subflooring.
Even with this thorough treatment,
it may take from 3 weeks to 3
months before all the larvae are
reached and killed.</p>

<p>The homeowner can best apply such
a quantity of insecticide by using a
sprayer or a pint-size plastic wash
bottle of the squeeze type, equipped
with a tube that will produce a pinpoint
stream. This makes it possible
to apply small enough quantities to
cover the surface without causing the
liquid to run off. Repeated applications
at different times are necessary
for complete absorption by the wood
and effective penetration. A pest-control
operator can obtain results
quickly by injecting the chemical under
pressure through boreholes spaced
at short intervals in the infested wood.</p>

<p class="caption3">Slow-Diffusion Method</p>

<p>Where pressure equipment is not
available and you want to use the bore-hole
or slow-diffusion method on isolated
infestations in wood that is
readily accessible, you can use the following
procedure:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Bore a downslanting hole about &frac12;
inch in diameter and 1 inch deep into the
wood near the place where a larva is working.</p>

<p>2. Insert a tight-fitting metal or glass tube
in the hole. Let about &frac14; inch of the tube
project.</p>

<p>3. Place one end of a rubber tube over
the projecting portion of the metal or glass
tube, and connect the other end with a
funnel. The funnel should be supported so
that it will stay in place until the treatment
has been completed.</p>

<p>4. Pour insecticide into the funnel. Use
any of the preparations mentioned in the
discussion of spraying and brushing. Leave
the equipment in place about 48 hours, or
until the insecticide is taken up. The insecticide
flows into the infested wood, is
absorbed for a distance of several inches
around the hole, and reaches and kills the
larva.</p></div>

<p>If several larvae are working in
places as much as 18 inches apart,
individual treatment is needed.</p>

<p class="caption3">Fumigation</p>

<p>Treatment of a heavy infestation of
powder-post beetles by spraying or
brushing or by the slow-diffusion
method is impractical where the wood
is hard to reach; particularly when it
is located behind plastered walls or
covered by paneling or insulation.</p>

<p><a id="fumigator" name="fumigator"></a>Such an infestation can be controlled
by fumigation&mdash;<i>but this work must be
done by a licensed fumigator</i>.</p>

<p>Hydrocyanic acid gas or methyl
bromide gas is used in fumigating.
Each is very poisonous, and heavy
dosages have to be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8 </a></span></p>

<p>After fumigation, the building must
be aired to make it safe for reoccupancy.
The fumigating and the airing
require 2 to 4 days.</p>

<p>Fumigation methods of the "home-remedy"
type&mdash;such as burning sulfur
candles&mdash;are ineffective because the
fumigant does not penetrate the infested
wood.</p>


<p class="caption2">PRECAUTIONS</p>

<p>The insecticides mentioned in this
leaflet are poisonous to people and to
animals. Keep them where children
and pets cannot reach them. Do not
let them come in contact with the body.
When applying them, wear rubber
gloves, a cellulose acetate type of face-guard,
and a rubber or leather apron.
When spraying an overhead area, do
not stand directly under it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guarding against explosions.</span>&mdash;Apply
a coarse spray. It is effective and
safe to use. A concentrated fine mist is
ineffective and may explode in the
presence of a spark or flame. Do not
smoke while spraying. Shut off pilot
lights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pressure.</span>&mdash;In spraying, use only
enough pressure to wet the surface of
the wood. Too much pressure may
cause spray to splash onto the body.
If you apply the insecticide in an
enclosed place, make sure that the air
can circulate freely. Keep doors and
windows open; if necessary, use a fan.
The purpose is to prevent odors from
accumulating in the building.</p>

<p>If you treat a floor that has a finished
ceiling under it&mdash;for example,
the floor of a second-story room&mdash;avoid
applying too much material. If
you do, it may run through to the ceiling
and cause a stain. Removal of
the floor finish before applying the insecticide
makes it unnecessary to apply
a large amount; the wood absorbs
most of it.</p>

<p>If you apply the oil solution to parquet
flooring, do it very lightly. If
you apply too much, the oil may dissolve
the asphalt in which the flooring
is set. The dissolved asphalt may
stain the floor. Around the edges of
the floor, it may "creep up" and damage
the walls.</p>

<p>If you have applied insecticide with
a garden sprayer, rinse out the tank
and hose before putting the sprayer
away. This prevents the gaskets from
shriveling and keeps oil from getting
on plants the next time the sprayer is
used in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Food cabinets.</span>&mdash;In treating a food
cabinet, do not use an insecticide because
it might contaminate food. Use
deodorized kerosene alone. It has
little odor and evaporates quickly.
Take the cabinet outdoors to treat it,
and leave it there until the kerosene
odor disappears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fumigation.</span>&mdash;The fact that fumigation
work must be done by a licensed
operator is stated on <a href="#fumigator">page 7</a>.</p>

<p>Only isolated buildings can be
safely fumigated. If an apartment, a
row house, or part of a duplex were
fumigated, the gas might penetrate
walls and kill persons in an adjoining
unit.</p>

<p>Methyl bromide gas is odorless, but
in the presence of articles having a
high sulfur content, or containing animal
matter, sponge rubber, or iodized
salt, a chemical change takes place and
a garliclike odor is apt to be given off
later. Before this gas is used, see
whether such articles are in the building;
if they are, remove them. This
need not be done if hydrocyanic acid
gas is used. However, hydrocyanic
acid gas tarnishes silver and spoils unexposed
photographic film; before it
is used, remove silver and film.</p>
